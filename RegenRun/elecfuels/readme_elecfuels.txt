* US-REGEN Electric+Fuels Model

* Descriptive text

* This is a partial equilibrium model of dispatch and new investment based on
* existing unit characteristics and hourly wind and load data.  Non-electric fuel
* markets, including hydrogen and e-fuels, along with linked markets for biomass
* feedstocks and CO2 storage and emissions, are integrated into the optimization.
* End-use fuels demands are exogenously specified based on iteratively updated
* End-use model results.

* Several modes of operation can be specified.

* - Stand-alone or as part of an iterative solve with end-use and other modules
* - Dynamic or static for a given year.
* - In static mode, new capacity can be "rented" or capacity can be fixed to
*   levels determined by optimal investment in a corresponding dynamic run.

* The scope is the US 2015 to 2050.  For dynamic runs, individual time periods
* are five years in length.

* The US is grouped into regions, which are interpreted as electricity
* markets.  The regions are state-based. There is trade between regions
* limited by aggregate inter-region transmission link capacity, which can be
* expanded (if desired).
