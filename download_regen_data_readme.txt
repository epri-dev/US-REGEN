The GitHub repository for US-REGEN includes model code and execution scripts, stored in the
RegenRun subfolder.  Input data files (stored in the RegenData and RegenReport folders)
must be downloaded separately from a public Box folder at https://epri.app.box.com. Users can
download this data directly from the link below, or use the included batch script to download
data files into the appropriate directory locations.
